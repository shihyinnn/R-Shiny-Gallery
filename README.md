# R-Shiny-Gallery - Health Insurance
This repository is a gallery for my Shiny apps using CMS health insurance data.

## Dataset: Health Insurance Marketplace PUFs
Health Insurance Marketplace PUFs (Public Use Files) are files with health plan information including benefits, copayments, premiums, and geographic coverage. While health plan information is publically available on Healthcare.gov, CMS has also released downloadable public use files (PUFs) so that researchers and other stakeholders can more easily access Marketplace data.

The Shiny apps were built with the Rate PUF - Plan-level data on the application of rates, such as allowed relationships (e.g., spouse, dependents) and tobacco use.
